In my Course of data analytics and python which i was doing with SKILLOVLLA as a project i was tasked to Make a dashboard for a atore and had to address key business analytics for provided retail datasheet.
So after revieving the data i modelled it according to my need and made pages with different level of analysis like product rating, delayed order etc and also secured 100/100 on this project.
